# Storage

Files with the same rule as everything else: **Postgres decides access.**
Each file is a row in `storage.objects`; RLS policies on that table say who
may upload, read, replace or delete it. The bytes live on the server's disk
or in any S3-compatible bucket. The design and its reasons are D77–D80 in
[decisions.md](decisions.md).

## Turning it on

New projects (`nelcota init`) keep files on the project's disk:

```sh
NELCOTA_STORAGE_BACKEND=disk
NELCOTA_STORAGE_DIR=/storage        # projects/<name>/storage on the host
```

In production, an S3-compatible bucket keeps files off a single disk
(Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, AWS S3, Wasabi...):

```sh
NELCOTA_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
NELCOTA_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com   # empty = AWS
NELCOTA_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=files
NELCOTA_STORAGE_S3_REGION=auto                                          # R2: auto; AWS: us-east-1...
NELCOTA_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
NELCOTA_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
# NELCOTA_STORAGE_S3_VIRTUAL_HOSTED=true   # bucket.endpoint URLs, if the provider requires them
```

Then `nelcota -p <name> up`. Without `NELCOTA_STORAGE_BACKEND` storage is off
and `/storage/v1` does not exist. A project created before storage existed
turns it on by adding the two `disk` lines to its `.env` and
`- ./storage:/storage` to the app's `volumes` in `docker-compose.yml`
(`mkdir storage && chown 65532:65532 storage` first).

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `NELCOTA_STORAGE_MAX_FILE_SIZE` | 50 MiB | largest file; a bucket can only lower it |
| `NELCOTA_STORAGE_MAX_TOTAL_SIZE` | none | cap on all buckets together, in bytes |
| `NELCOTA_STORAGE_MIN_FREE_BYTES` | 1 GiB | disk backend: refuse uploads that would leave less free space |
| `NELCOTA_STORAGE_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECS` | 3600 | longest an upload may take |
| `NELCOTA_STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` | the API's | origin of public file URLs, e.g. `https://files.shop.com` |

## Buckets and policies

A bucket is a row in `storage.buckets`. Create it in a migration (or with
`POST /storage/v1/bucket` as `service_role`):

```sql
-- migrations/V2__avatars.sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES ('avatars', true, 2097152, '{image/*}');

-- Each user writes only into the folder named after their id.
CREATE POLICY avatar_owner ON storage.objects FOR ALL TO authenticated
    USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text)
    WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);
```

**Until a policy says otherwise, nobody but `service_role` reaches any file.**
`public` only opens reads through `/object/public/`; writes to a public bucket
still go through the policies.

| Operation | Policies needed |
|---|---|
| upload (`POST`) | `INSERT` |
| replace (`PUT`) | `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE` |
| download, sign, list | `SELECT` |
| delete | `SELECT`, `DELETE` |

`owner` is filled with `auth.uid()` on upload, so `owner = auth.uid()` is the
simplest private-files policy. Helpers for paths:
`storage.foldername('a/b/c.png')` → `{a,b}`, `storage.filename(...)` →
`c.png`, `storage.extension(...)` → `png`. A policy sees the final row,
including `size`, so a per-user quota is a policy too:

```sql
CREATE POLICY quota ON storage.objects AS RESTRICTIVE FOR INSERT TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK ((SELECT coalesce(sum(size), 0) FROM storage.objects
                  WHERE owner = auth.uid()) + size <= 100 * 1024 * 1024);
```

Bucket names: lowercase letters, digits, `-` and `_`; `public`, `sign` and
`list` are reserved. A bucket with files cannot be dropped.

## HTTP API

Every route takes the usual `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` (none = `anon`).
Paths are percent-encoded; segments cannot be empty, `.` or `..`.

```sh
# upload (409 if the name exists; PUT replaces)
curl -X POST "$API/storage/v1/object/avatars/$USER_ID/me.png" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'content-type: image/png' --data-binary @me.png
# {"id":"...","bucket":"avatars","name":"<id>/me.png","size":48213,
#  "mime_type":"image/png","etag":"...","public_url":"/storage/v1/object/public/avatars/<id>/me.png"}

curl "$API/storage/v1/object/avatars/$USER_ID/me.png" -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"   # download
curl "$API/storage/v1/object/public/avatars/$USER_ID/me.png"                               # public bucket
curl -X DELETE "$API/storage/v1/object/avatars/$USER_ID/me.png" -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

| Route | |
|---|---|
| `POST /storage/v1/object/{bucket}/{path}` | upload a new file (201) |
| `PUT /storage/v1/object/{bucket}/{path}` | upload or replace (200 replaced, 201 created) |
| `GET /storage/v1/object/{bucket}/{path}` | download under the caller's policies |
| `GET /storage/v1/object/public/{bucket}/{path}` | download from a public bucket, no token |
| `POST /storage/v1/object/sign/{bucket}/{path}` | `{"expires_in": 3600}` → `{"signed_url": "..."}` (up to 7 days) |
| `GET /storage/v1/object/sign/{bucket}/{path}?token=...` | download with a signed URL, no token |
| `POST /storage/v1/object/list/{bucket}` | `{"prefix": "a/", "limit": 100, "offset": 0}` → `{"folders": [...], "objects": [...]}` |
| `DELETE /storage/v1/object/{bucket}/{path}` | delete (204) |
| `GET/POST /storage/v1/bucket`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /storage/v1/bucket/{id}` | buckets (writes: `service_role`) |

A file the caller may not see answers 404, as if it did not exist. Downloads
take `?download` to force a "save as". Errors: 400 `invalid_path`, 404
`bucket_not_found`/`object_not_found`, 409 `object_exists`, 413
`file_too_large`, 415 `mime_type_not_allowed`, 507 `storage_full`.

## How files are served

- **The type comes from the bytes**, not from the client: a "PNG" that is
  really HTML is stored as `text/html` (and refused by an `image/*` bucket).
- **Files are inert.** Every response has `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and
  `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`. Only images (not SVG), audio, video and
  plain text open in the browser; HTML, SVG, PDF and the rest download.
  For public files on their own origin, point `NELCOTA_STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL` at
  a second domain that proxies `/storage/v1/object/public/*` to the app.
- **Disk:** `Range` (video seeking, resumed downloads), `ETag` and
  `If-None-Match`. Public files are cacheable for 60 s; private ones are
  revalidated each time.
- **S3:** downloads are a `302` to a presigned URL valid for at most 5 minutes;
  the bytes come straight from the provider.

## Consistency

A file's bytes are stored under a new key (`<bucket>/<uuidv7>`) on every
upload, and the row is written only after the bytes are complete. Readers
never see a half-written file, and an upload that fails or is refused leaves
nothing behind. Replacing or deleting a file removes the old bytes right
away: **a database restore does not bring deleted files back**. An hourly
collector removes bytes no row points to once they are a day old (left by a
crash mid-upload).

## Backups

With the disk backend, every dump has its own `<dump>.files/` snapshot and
SHA-256 manifest. `nelcota backup --upload` uploads that immutable snapshot to
`s3://<backup bucket>/<project>/<dump>.files/`. Later file deletions leave older
snapshots intact. After losing the server:

```sh
nelcota -p shop restore backups/nelcota-shop-<date>.dump --files --yes
```

`--files` verifies and restores that dump's snapshot, locally or from the backup
bucket. Keep the `.dump` and `.dump.files/` directory together. With the S3 backend the
files never leave the provider; use its versioning or replication if you need
more copies.

## Leaving

The metadata is plain SQL (`storage.objects`), the bytes are ordinary files or
S3 objects. To get them back under their names:

```sql
SELECT bucket_id || '/' || version AS key, bucket_id || '/' || name AS name
  FROM storage.objects;
```
