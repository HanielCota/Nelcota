# REST API

Generated from the exposed schema (`NELCOTA_DB_SCHEMA`, default `public`). Every
table, view and function in the schema becomes an endpoint, and **Postgres
decides access**: GRANTs say which roles may use each object and RLS says which
rows each user sees.

> New tables have no GRANT for `anon`/`authenticated`: until you grant it, the
> API answers 401/403. This is intentional.
>
> ```sql
> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public.my_table TO authenticated;
> ALTER TABLE public.my_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
> CREATE POLICY ... ;
> ```

## Reads: `GET /rest/v1/{table}`

| Parameter | Example | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `select` | `select=id,title` | columns (default `*`) and embedded relations, see below |
| `{column}` | `price=gt.10` | filter (several are combined with AND) |
| `or`, `and` | `or=(status.eq.paid,status.eq.shipped)` | group of filters, see below |
| `order` | `order=created_at.desc.nullslast,id` | ordering |
| `limit`, `offset` | `limit=20&offset=40` | pagination |

### Operators

| Operator | SQL | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `eq`, `neq` | `=`, `<>` | `status=eq.active` |
| `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` | `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` | `age=gte.18` |
| `like`, `ilike` | `LIKE`, `ILIKE` (`*` becomes `%`) | `name=ilike.*silva*` |
| `in` | `= ANY(...)` | `id=in.(1,2,3)`, `name=in.("a,b",c)` |
| `is` | `IS NULL/TRUE/FALSE/UNKNOWN` | `deleted_at=is.null` |
| `not.` | `NOT (...)` | `status=not.eq.cancelled`, `x=not.is.null` |

Values reach Postgres as parameters and Postgres itself converts them to the
column type (`$1::text::<type>`). A value invalid for the type gives 400.

### Embedding related rows

`select` follows foreign keys in either direction, so one request returns an
order with its customer and items:

```
GET /rest/v1/orders?select=id,total,customers(name),items(product,qty)

[{ "id": 10, "total": 30.00,
   "customers": { "name": "Ana" },
   "items": [{ "product": "Pen", "qty": 2 }, { "product": "Ruler", "qty": 1 }] }]
```

- When this table has the foreign key (`orders.customer_id → customers`), the
  embed is an **object**, or `null` when nothing matches. When the other table
  points here (`items.order_id → orders`), it is an **array**, `[]` when empty.
- `items(*)` takes every column. `purchases:orders(*)` renames the key.
- Two foreign keys to the same table (`buyer_id`, `seller_id` → `users`) are
  ambiguous: pick one with the column or the constraint name,
  `buyer:users!buyer_id(email),seller:users!seller_id(email)`. The error lists
  the options.
- Embeds nest, up to 4 levels: `customers?select=name,orders(id,items(product))`.
  A table cannot be embedded into itself (self-reference). A key that repeats
  a selected column is a 400: rename it with an alias.
- **RLS applies to the embedded table** too: each embed runs with the request's
  role, so it shows exactly what a direct read of that table would. A related
  row the user cannot see becomes `null` or is left out of the array.
- Works in the representation of writes (`return=representation`).
- Each embed is a correlated subquery: index the foreign key columns on the
  "many" side (Postgres does not create those indexes on its own).

### Filtering, ordering and paging embedded rows

A parameter prefixed with the embed's key (its alias, when it has one) applies
to the embedded rows; a deeper embed adds its key to the path:

```
GET /rest/v1/customers?select=name,orders(id,total,items(product))
    &orders.total=gte.5
    &orders.order=total.desc
    &orders.limit=2
    &orders.items.or=(qty.eq.1,qty.gt.5)
```

- Every filter operator and `or`/`and` work, plus `order`, `limit` and
  `offset`. Paging only applies to arrays: on a single-row embed it is a 400.
- These narrow the **embedded rows only**: the parent rows stay, with `[]` or
  `null` where nothing matched. Filters on the parent table (`?id=eq.1`) still
  pick the parent rows.
- The order of the parameters in the URL does not matter.

### Combining filters: `or` and `and`

Same syntax as PostgREST. Inside the parentheses each filter is written
`column.operator.value`:

```
?or=(status.eq.paid,status.eq.shipped)
?or=(stock.eq.0,and(price.gt.100,featured.is.true))
?not.or=(status.eq.cancelled,deleted_at.not.is.null)
?or=(price.gt.100,price.lt.3)&stock=gt.0      # the group is ANDed with the rest
```

- `and(...)` and `or(...)` nest; `not.` before a group negates it, and
  `column.not.operator.value` negates one filter.
- A value with commas or parentheses goes in double quotes, with `\"` and `\\`
  as escapes: `or=(name.eq."Ruler, 30cm",name.eq."f(x)")`. `in` lists keep
  their own quoting.
- At most 8 nested levels and 100 filters per group; beyond that, 400.
- A column literally named `or` or `and` cannot be used as a direct filter,
  only inside a group (`and=(or.eq.1)`), as in PostgREST.
- RLS still applies: a group can only narrow what the policies allow, never
  widen it, on reads and on `PATCH`/`DELETE`.

### Responses

- Body: a JSON array built by Postgres (`json_agg`).
- `Content-Range: 0-19/*`, or `0-19/137` with `Prefer: count=exact`.
- `NELCOTA_MAX_ROWS` defaults to **1000** and must be positive. It caps the root
  read, each embedded collection, and set-returning RPCs, including explicit
  limits larger than the cap. Embedded collections in write representations
  have a fixed cap of 1000. Paginate collections to reach subsequent rows.
- JSON has an **8 MiB serialization budget**, checked in PostgreSQL before each
  row enters an aggregate, also on write representations and scalar RPCs.
  Intermediate embedded values count towards the same budget, so deeply nested
  results can reach it with less than 8 MiB of final output. Oversized results
  return `413 response_too_large`; a write requesting such a representation
  rolls back. A single database value must still be serialized before its size
  can be checked. Administrative streaming exports remain available for large data.
- `select` accepts at most 128 items across the relation tree. Repeated columns
  are rejected; `*` already includes explicitly selected columns.

## Writes

An insert accepts at most **1000 rows** and **128 distinct column sets** per
request. Split larger batches into requests. A request body (writes and RPC
arguments) can have at most `NELCOTA_MAX_BODY_BYTES` bytes, **2 MiB** by
default; a larger one gets `413 payload_too_large`. The body is buffered and
parsed whole, so raise the limit only as far as the server's memory allows. Each accepted request keeps its
transactional behavior and missing columns still receive their defaults.

| Verb | Body | Filters | Without `return=representation` | With `return=representation` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | object or array | not accepted | 201 empty | 201 + array |
| `PATCH` | object | **required** | 204 | 200 + array |
| `DELETE` | - | **required** | 204 | 200 + array |

- `select=` also picks the columns of the representation.
- On `POST`, missing columns get their `DEFAULT`, even in a batch whose
  objects have different keys.
- An empty body on `POST`/`PATCH` is refused (400 `invalid_body`); to insert
  a row of defaults, send `{}`. An `/rpc` call without a body has no arguments.
- `PATCH`/`DELETE` without a filter are refused (400), to avoid changing or
  deleting the whole table by mistake. To do that on purpose, use an explicit
  filter (`?id=not.is.null`).
- `order`, `limit` and `offset` are refused on `PATCH`/`DELETE` (400
  `invalid_query`): they change every row the filters match, so narrow the
  filters instead.
- With `Prefer: count=exact`, `PATCH`/`DELETE` answer `Content-Range: */<n>`
  with the number of rows changed (and `Preference-Applied: count=exact`),
  with or without `return=representation`.
- `return=representation` runs `RETURNING`, which requires `SELECT`
  permission (GRANT + policy) on the written rows.

### Upsert: create or update in one call

```
POST /rest/v1/products
Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates
[{ "id": 1, "price": 3.00 }, { "id": 99, "name": "Eraser", "price": 1.00 }]
```

- `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates` updates a row whose key already exists,
  with the columns the object sent (the others keep their values; the key
  itself is never changed). `resolution=ignore-duplicates` keeps the existing
  row; with `return=representation`, only the rows actually written come back.
- The key is the primary key, or `?on_conflict=col1,col2`, which must match a
  unique constraint (otherwise 400). `on_conflict` without `resolution` is a
  400. The response confirms with `Preference-Applied`.
- A batch that repeats a key gets a 400 from Postgres (a row cannot be updated
  twice in one statement).
- A `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` column cannot receive values, so it cannot
  be the upsert key: use `BY DEFAULT`, or another unique column with
  `on_conflict`.
- RLS still decides: on a conflict, the existing row must pass the `UPDATE`
  policy. A user cannot take over someone else's row through an upsert (403).

## Functions: `POST /rest/v1/rpc/{function}`

Body: an object with the **named** arguments (`{"a": 1, "b": 2}`); arguments
with a `DEFAULT` are optional. With overloads, the signature whose names match
the keys wins.

| Function returns | Response |
|---|---|
| `SETOF`/`TABLE` | JSON array |
| scalar or composite | JSON value |
| `void` | 204 |

`RAISE EXCEPTION` becomes 400 with the message, also with a custom SQLSTATE of
class `P0` (`USING ERRCODE = 'P0002'`) and for a failed `ASSERT`; its `DETAIL`
and `HINT` come back as `details` and `hint` (see [Errors](#errors)). The
function runs with the JWT's role (unless it is `SECURITY DEFINER`):
`auth.uid()` works inside it.

> **Warning:** By default, Postgres grants `EXECUTE` on new functions to
> `PUBLIC` (including `anon`). For sensitive functions:
> `REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION f() FROM PUBLIC; GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION f() TO authenticated;`

## OpenAPI: `GET /rest/v1/`

An OpenAPI 3.0 document generated from the catalog and **filtered by the
request's role**: `anon` only sees what `anon` may use.

Schema models: `nelcota types -o database.ts` (TypeScript, default), or
`nelcota types --lang rust -o database.rs` for the
[Rust SDK](../sdk/rust/README.md). The Rust models distinguish omitted write
fields from explicit nulls and keep Postgres numeric precision.

## Catalog reload

The API keeps the introspection in memory. An event trigger (migration V3)
notifies the server on every DDL and the reload happens in ~100 ms. Without a
superuser (some managed Postgres services), reload by hand:

```sql
NOTIFY nelcota, 'reload schema';
```

## Errors

Every error from the server (REST, auth, storage, unknown routes, wrong
methods, body limits and timeouts) is JSON with the same shape:

```json
{"code": "db_error", "message": "duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"products_pkey\" (23505)",
 "sqlstate": "23505", "details": "Key (id)=(1) already exists.", "constraint": "products_pkey"}
```

- `code` and `message` are always present. `code` is stable and meant for
  programs; `message` is English text for people.
- Errors that come from Postgres add `sqlstate` (the 5-character SQLSTATE)
  and, when Postgres provides them, `details`, `hint` and `constraint`
  (`DETAIL`, `HINT` and the violated constraint's name). Absent fields are
  omitted, never `null`. For `db_error`, `message` stays `"<text> (<sqlstate>)"`.
- Every response carries `x-request-id` (see [Request IDs](#request-ids)):
  quote it when reporting an error.

| Status | `code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_query` | invalid column/operator/order in the URL; `order`/`limit`/`offset` on `PATCH`/`DELETE` |
| 400 | `invalid_body` | the body is not valid JSON, or is empty on `POST`/`PATCH` |
| 400 | `db_error` | value invalid for the type, check, not null, generated column, `RAISE EXCEPTION` (any SQLSTATE of class `P0`) |
| 401 | `invalid_token` | invalid or expired JWT (`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token"`) |
| 401 | `db_error` | `anon` without permission: sign in (`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`) |
| 403 | `db_error` | role without permission, or a policy violated on write |
| 404 | `not_found` | table/function outside the exposed schema, or an unknown route |
| 405 | `method_not_allowed` | the route exists but not with this method (`Allow` lists the methods) |
| 409 | `db_error` | unique key, foreign key or exclusion constraint violated |
| 413 | `payload_too_large` | request body over `NELCOTA_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (default 2 MiB) |
| 413 | `response_too_large` | the JSON response would exceed the 8 MiB budget |
| 415 | `unsupported_media_type` | an auth or storage JSON endpoint without `Content-Type: application/json` |
| 422 | `invalid_body` | an auth or storage JSON body with a missing field or a field of the wrong type |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | too many attempts (`Retry-After`) |
| 500 | `internal` | unexpected error; details only in the server log |
| 503 | `unavailable` | database unreachable, or a transient failure: serialization failure (`40001`), deadlock (`40P01`), lock not available (`55P03`), too many connections (`53300`), server shutting down or starting (`57P01`, `57P02`, `57P03`). Comes with `Retry-After: 1` (and `sqlstate` when Postgres answered): retry the request |
| 504 | `db_error` | `statement_timeout` (`NELCOTA_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 10 s; `sqlstate` `57014`) |
| 504 | `timeout` | the whole request took longer than `NELCOTA_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 15 s, must exceed the statement timeout) |

Auth and storage add their own codes; see [schema-auth.md](schema-auth.md) and
[storage.md](storage.md).

## Request IDs

Each response carries an `x-request-id` header: the one the request came with
(for example from a proxy in front), or a new UUID. The server logs one line
per response at `INFO` with the method, path (never the query string), status,
latency and that id, so an error a user reports can be found in the log.
Browsers can read the header (it is in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`).

## Out of the MVP

Filtering parent rows by their embeds (PostgREST's `!inner`),
self-referencing embeds, `GET` on `/rpc`, `Accept: application/vnd.pgrst.object+json`.
