-- Schema for the SDK examples (TypeScript and Rust): private notes and a
-- private `files` bucket where each user writes under a folder named after
-- their id. Safe to run more than once.
--
-- Apply it to a development project as the database owner, either:
--   * copy it to migrations/V1__notes.sql (or the next free version) and run
--     `nelcota migrate`, or
--   * paste it into the SQL editor of the panel (/admin/).
--
-- It is not part of Nelcota's own migrations: Nelcota creates no business
-- tables in anyone's database.
